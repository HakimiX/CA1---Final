                    <h4>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</h4>
                    <p>In our application, we have used the Transmission Control Protocol. This protocol is used to 
                       initiate af "Point-to-Point" client-server connection. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>TCP is a "reliable" protocol, in other words, it guarantees the delivery of the data
                            it transmits in the form of "packets."</p></li>
                        <li><p>If packets are lost or damaged, TCP will resend the data until it verifies that packets
                            have been successfully transmitted.</p></li>
                        <li><p>TCP is needed for applications that must reliably send messages back and forth or initiate
                            file transfers to ensure that a perfect copy of the data arrives at the other sides uncorrupted.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>TCP/IP Sockets</h4>
                    <p>When establishing connectivity, the client and server each bind a "socket" to their end of the connection.
                       Once a connection has been established the client and server both read from and write to the "socket"
                       when communicating.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Client-Server Application</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>Create a Socket or ServerSocket object and open it over a specified "port" and "ip" 
                            address or host name. Example - "localhost", 9090</p></li>
                        <li><p>Instantiate "InputStreamReader, BufferedReader and PrintStream" objects to stram 
                            data to and from each socket.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Read from and write to the stream between the sockets using their agreed-upon protocol.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Close the input and output streams</p></li>
                        <li><p>Close the Sockets or ServerSocket objects.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>State Behaviour</h4>
                    <p>The "Server" created a ServerSocket object and open it over a specified "port" and "ip" 
                                address or host name, in our case "localhost", 9090. The client creates a socket, and once
                            a connection between the sockets has been established, the client and server both read from and 
                            write to the socket. The Server calls the "accept()" method and create a new Thread for the client.
                            When using "Terminal" on Mac or "Command Prompt" on Windows, the first thing you have to do is 
                            use a protocol tag - "USER#name", to create a user. Once a user has been created, the "USERLIST#"
                            will be available with all online/connected users. All online/connected clients will receive the
                            list. Communication between the clients, is done through the agreed upon procotol - "MSG#receiver#msg".
                            The connection is stopped, when calling the "STOP#" protocol</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Observer Design Pattern</h4>
                    <p>We have implemented the Observer design pattern. The Observer design pattern define a one-to-many
                    dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified
                    and updated automatically. Observer design pattern falls under "behavioral pattern" category.
                    The "ChatGUI" class implements observer, with the abstract method "update()" implemented. The 
                    "Client" class extends "Observable", and everytime we receive a message, the "notfiy()" method is 
                    called. The "notify()" method notifies all the observers. </p>
